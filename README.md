A Symfony project created on September 28, 2016, 12:39 pm.

This project is my attempt to create a symfony 2.8 web app from scratch. This app has been written primarily by myself, but I have had the help and mentoring of [Sam Edge](https://au.linkedin.com/in/sam-edge-626b5647) and [Michael Kubler](http://www.kublermdk.com/).

This web app is being designed within the standards of Google Material Design, using inspiration from [Material Design Lites](https://getmdl.io/index.html) template ideas, and using the CSS/JS components provided by [Materialize](http://materializecss.com/about.html).
