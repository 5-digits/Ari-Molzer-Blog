=================

A Symfony project created on September 28, 2016, 12:39 pm.

This project is my attempt to create a symfony 3 web app from scratch. This app has been written primarily by myself, but I have had the guidance and mentoring of [Sam Edge](https://au.linkedin.com/in/sam-edge-626b5647) and [Michael Kubler](http://www.kublermdk.com/).

This web app is being designed within the standards of Google Material Design, using inspiration from [Material Design Lites](https://getmdl.io/index.html) template ideas, and using the CSS/JS components provided by [Materialize](http://materializecss.com/about.html).

My hopes for this project is that I will be able to showcase my skills, by producing a beautiful end result, that has been cleanly written; with well commented and clearly documented code.
